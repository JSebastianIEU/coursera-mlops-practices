    "# Minimal Python Book: Storing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter 2 of the Minimal Python book** explores fundamental data structures in Python, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. You can read the full chapter online [here](https://minimalpython.com/chapter2).\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers basic data structures in Python, including their common operations and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists** store ordered, mutable items.\n",
    "- **Tuples** are immutable lists.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries** map unique keys to values.\n",
    "- **Sets** contain only unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting and manipulating the right data structure is essential for effective Python programming.\n",

    "## Top 3 Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists** store ordered, mutable items.\n",
    "2. **Dictionaries** map unique keys to values.\n",
    "3. **Sets** contain only unique elements.\n",

    "## Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- When would you want to use a tuple over a list?\n",
    "- What real-world examples can be modeled with dictionaries?\n",
    "- How could sets help improve the efficiency of a program?\n",
    "- What issues can arise from nested data structures?\n",
    "- Why is proper data structure selection important when coding?\n",
